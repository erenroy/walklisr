We use various IT tools to detect and defend against online security threats (e.g., attacks, viruses, malware, spam, phishing, malicious web content), to promote business continuity of our information systems and assets, and to maintain optimal performance of our IT systems. Likewise, to ensure physical security of our facilities we may, where permitted under local law, document your presence, verify your identity, utilize surveillance systems, and/or use location tracking while you are on Company property.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #333;">Opt-In Information</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">We may obtain your explicit consent to collect and use certain types of personal information when we are required to do so by law (for example, in relation to our direct marketing activities).

We may also present you with the opportunity to consent to the sharing of your information with third parties. If you agree to have your personal information shared, your personal information will be disclosed to the third-party subject to the privacy notice and business practices of that third party.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #333;">Other Uses of Information</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">We may use the personal information you provide to us for internal general business purposes in accordance with our legitimate business interests. These purposes include administration of our websites, data analytics, fraud prevention, and compliance with our legal obligations, standards, policies, and procedures (i.e., due diligence checks and sanction screening where applicable).</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #333;">Publicly Available Information</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">We obtain personal information that is lawfully made available from federal, state, and local government records. We also obtain personal information from third parties which have lawfully collected such information directly from consumers, government records, from widely distributed media, or other sources which have the right to share such information with the third party. We use all the foregoing publicly available information to advance our legitimate business interests, including, but not limited to, providing data and technology services to our customers, in accordance with applicable law.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #333;">IP Address</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the online services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, apps, and other services. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems, and administering our online services. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address to understand from what regions of the world our website visitors come.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #333;">Geolocation Based Services</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">We may collect geolocation data (i.e., the physical location of your device) if you have consented to us doing so, by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, Wi-Fi signals, or other technologies. We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with location-based services and content. For example, if you download one of our apps for use in performing activities for a non-profit organizations, political organization, or other entity, we may collect the geolocation of your mobile device (if you consent to the collection of this data) to provide information for the benefit of you and other users.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #333;">Pixel Tags or Similar Technologies</h3>

We also use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixels, and similar services which use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of our services and report on activities and trends. These services may collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps, and online resources.

<h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #333;">Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">In order to carry out your requests, to make various features, services, and materials available to you through the services, to respond to your inquiries, and for other purposes described in the “How We Use Your Information” section of this Privacy Policy, we may share your personal information or usage information with third parties that perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our partners), such as companies or individuals that: host or operate our sites; analyze data; provide customer service; manage payments; marketing and advertising companies (e.g., The Trade Desk); e-commerce activities, or assist with risk management, compliance, legal and audit functions.

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">When you use Walk List Pro products (e.g., apps), for example, as an employee, volunteer, or representative of an Walk List Pro customer, you are agreeing that Walk List Pro has the right to share information related to your usage of the Walk List Pro product with the corresponding Walk List Pro customer.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #333;">Automated Decisions About You</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">Automated processing may be used when evaluating large numbers of applicants for job vacancies. For these purposes we would request that you create a profile and answer some job-related questions to evaluate your skills as compared to the published job requirements. An algorithm may then be used to determine which candidates will be allowed to proceed to the next step within the selection process. We consider this data and process to be relevant because it will assist us to select the applicant most suitable for our vacancies. The outcome of the evaluation may have an impact on whether you are offered a role for the vacancy to which you applied.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #333;">User-Generated Content</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">Some of our services and social networking features may enable you to submit your own content for public posting. Information you post in this fashion becomes public information and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. Certain areas of our websites and our social media pages may enable users to submit personal information to Walk List Pro. Such information will be used in accordance with the website’s Privacy Policy. Postings, letters, and other submissions become the property of Walk List Pro and may be reproduced in whole or in part, including your name, for any purpose and in any manner.</p>

To the extent that any linked services are not provided by Walk List Pro, we are not responsible for the services, or any of the content found on these websites. If you provide information on and use third-party services or websites, the privacy policy, and terms of service on those sites are applicable.

<h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #333;">How We Protect Personal Information</h3>
